# PredictEmployeeChurn
Identify main drivers of employee churn and predict when employees will quit

Employee turnover is a very costly problem for companies. The cost of replacing an employee if often larger than 100K USD, taking into account the time spent to interview and find a replacement, placement fees, sign-on bonuses and the loss of productivity for several months.

We got employee data from a few companies. We have data about all employees who joined from 2011/01/24 to 2015/12/13. For each employee, we also know if they are still at the company as of 2015/12/13 or they have quit. Beside that, we have general info about the employee, such as average salary during her tenure, department, and years of experience.
As said above, the goal is to predict employee retention and understand its main drivers
